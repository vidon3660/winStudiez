winStudiez
==========

This is the unofficial iStudiez Windows Application. It will be released on the Windows Store as Metro App and as normal Desktop Application.
On release it'll support all current iStudiez functions such as the calendar, time tables, classes and class tests. We also try to implement the synchronization feature
to enable syncrhonization with the iStudiez.com Account.

It's developed in C# and of course, open source. License provided in LICENSE.md-File.
